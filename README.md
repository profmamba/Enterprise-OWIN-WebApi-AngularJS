#Enterprise Scaffolding for SPA and WebApi projects

##Overview

First off, as with all open projects this is a work in progress. It is a port of actual production code that I am busy developing in my spare time (minus some obvious deployment bits and keys etc). Feel free to use as you see fit, let me know where it sucks. I accept no responsibility for anything you do with this, even if it kills your cat.

###Goals:

* Scalable, secure, testable enterprise scaffolding for new SPA and WebApi projects
* Have an open, interchangeable data context / repository system (implemented Mongo as first repo)
* Get familiar with new OWIN / Katana concepts
