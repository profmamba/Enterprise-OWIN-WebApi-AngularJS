##Enterprise Scaffolding for SPA and WebApi projects

##Overview

First off, as with all open projects this is a work in progress. It is a port of actual production code (minus some obvious deployment bits and keys etc) that I am busy developing in my spare time. 

The goals are:
1. Scalable, secure enterprise scaffolding for new SPA and WebApi projects
2. Get familiar with new OWIN / Katana concepts
3. Have an open, interchangeable repo system that is NOT SQL (for once)
